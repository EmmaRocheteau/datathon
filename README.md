## Pickled in Brine - Team Chloride

The AI:Med allowed competing teams to run queries on two ICU databases (eICU and MIMIC v 3) that have been made accesible and curated by the [MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology](https://github.com/MIT-LCP). 

Suppported by hosting of these datasets by Google Big Query, teams were able to interogate the database and build their own models. The queries and code contained in this repository is part of the analysis for our project exploring the effects of hyperchloraemia on ICU patients from the eICU dataset. 

In order to run these queries you will require your own instance of eICU running. This is available from [Physionet](https://physionet.org) following an authorisation process and some eLearning modules. It is possible to manage this data in a Google Big Query bucket. Details of how to do this can be found via the [MIMIC database landing page](https://mimic.physionet.org/).
